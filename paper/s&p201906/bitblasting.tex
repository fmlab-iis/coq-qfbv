% overview of the parts with certification holes. From formally defined SMT-LIB2
% formed bitvectors to cnf format.
% SMT solver with bitvector theory is utilized to transform
% specifications of bitvector operations to cnf representations. Then, the
% cnf is sent to SAT solvers to obtain sat or unsat results.
% The uncertainty of the transformation remains a hole in the certified
% process. The question is raised when experimenting the checker for the range
% properties.

% SMT-LIB2 is used in ? SMT solvers. 

% define the 'env', mapping, encoding and etc.

% design own library of bit blasting, to ensure two goals: proofs and execution.
Coq library itself contents a library for bits representation -- Coq-bits.
In its definition, the bit vector is in tuple of Boolean with least significant bit at head.

% example: add

% code extraction, extra efforts to make execution efficient
